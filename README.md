# Pedestrian Intent Prediction for Autonomous Mobile Robots

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting pedestrian intent for autonomous mobile robots using advanced machine learning techniques. The system processes video and depth data to analyze pedestrian actions and intentions, enabling safer and more efficient navigation.

## Features
- **Dataset Management**: Tools for handling and validating datasets.
- **Action Recognition**: Annotate pedestrian actions for training models.
- **Intent Prediction**: Label pedestrian intentions for predictive analysis.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract and process data from various sources, including ROS bags.
- **Visualization**: Combine RGB and depth frames for better insights.
